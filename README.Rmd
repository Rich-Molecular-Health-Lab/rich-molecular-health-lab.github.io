# Rich Lab for Molecular Health

Welcome to the source repository for the [Rich Lab for Molecular Health](https://rich-molecular-health-lab.github.io) website.

This site is built with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using the `html_document` format and is published via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) as the official homepage for the Rich Lab.

## 🔬 About the Lab

The Rich Lab, based at the University of Nebraska Omaha, uses molecular biology, conservation genomics, bioinformatics, and physiology to improve the health, welfare, and conservation of mammals—especially primates.

We apply integrative, evidence-based approaches to real-world challenges at the interface of wildlife, zoos, and human health.
