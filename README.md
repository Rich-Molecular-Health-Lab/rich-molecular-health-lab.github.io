## 🔬 About the Lab

The Rich Lab, based at the University of Nebraska Omaha, uses molecular biology, conservation genomics, bioinformatics, and physiology to improve the health, welfare, and conservation of mammals—especially primates.

We apply integrative, evidence-based approaches to real-world challenges at the interface of wildlife, zoos, and human health.
