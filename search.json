Mention how your\nbackground/experience so far has guided your interest, and what about\nthe work we are doing is a good fit for the kind of questions you see\nyourself investigating. Also, say a bit about what you are looking for\nin a graduate advisor/lab. Are you someone who works well under more\nstructure or more freedom? What kind of logistical/social/academic\nsupport is most likely to help you succeed? I also encourage you to\nreach out to members or alums of this lab to gain some insight into what\nyou might expect.\n\n\nFor those interested in getting undergraduate\nresearch experience:\nIf you can, then you should sign up for one of Dr.¬†Rich‚Äôs elective\nclasses - generally either Conservation Biology (offered every\nsemester), Zoo Biology (offered every spring semester), or Human Health\n& the Environment (offered every fall semester). That is the best\nway to determine whether my research interests and the academic culture\nI foster align with your needs. You can enquire about opportunities in\nthe lab at that time, or send an email. If we have some extra space\navailable, you may start attending the weekly lab meetings. After that,\nstudents generally work out the level of commitment and independence\nthey are looking for, and we plan your future in the lab from there.\nContact: Dr.¬†Alicia Rich (Email)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
